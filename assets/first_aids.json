      "type": "Dislocation",
      "info": "Dislocation is a displacement of the articular ends of bones, partially or completely disrupting their mutual contact. \nSigns:\n    1) the appearance of intense pain in the area of the affected joint;\n    2) impaired limb function, manifested in the inability to perform active movements;\n    3) forced position of the limb and deformity of the joint shape;\n    4) displacement of the articular head with desolation of the articular capsule and springy fixation of the limb in its abnormal position.\n\nTraumatic dislocations of the joints require immediate first aid. A timely dislocation, with proper subsequent treatment, will lead to a complete restoration of the impaired limb function.",
      "first_aid": "First aid should consist, as a rule, in fixing the injured limb, giving an anesthetic and sending the victim to a medical institution. Fixation of the limb is carried out by dressing or hanging it on a scarf. In case of dislocations of the joints of the lower limb, the victim must be taken to a medical institution in a supine position (on a stretcher), with pillows placed under the limb, its fixation and giving the victim an anesthetic. When providing first aid in unclear cases, when it was not possible to distinguish a dislocation from a fracture, the victim should be treated as if he had an obvious bone fracture.",

      "type": "Bleeding",
      "info": "Bleeding is the outpouring of blood from damaged blood vessels. It is one of the frequent and dangerous consequences of wounds, injuries and burns. Depending on the type of damaged vessel, arterial, capillary and venous bleeding are distinguished.",
      "first_aid": "1. ARTERIAL BLEEDING occurs when the arteries are damaged and is the most dangerous.\n\nSIGNS: scarlet blood is pouring out of the wound in a strong pulsating stream.\n\nFIRST AID is aimed at stopping bleeding, which can be carried out by giving the bleeding area an elevated position, applying a pressure bandage, maximum flexion of the limb in the joint and squeezing the vessels passing in this area, finger pressing, applying a tourniquet. The vessel is pressed above the wound, at certain anatomical points, where the muscle mass is less pronounced, the vessel passes superficially and can be pressed against the underlying bone. It is better to press not with one, but with several fingers of one or both hands.\n\n2. VENOUS BLEEDING occurs when the walls of the veins are damaged.\n\nSIGNS: dark blood is flowing out of the wound in a slow continuous stream.\n\nFIRST AID consists in stopping the bleeding, for which it is enough to give an elevated position to the limb, bend it as much as possible in the joint or apply a pressure bandage. This position is given to the limb only after applying a pressure bandage. With severe venous bleeding, they resort to pressing the vessel. The damaged vessel is pressed against the bone below the wound. This method is convenient because it can be performed immediately and does not require any devices.\n\n3. CAPILLARY BLEEDING is a consequence of damage to the smallest blood vessels (capillaries).\n\nSIGNS: the entire wound surface is bleeding.\n\nFIRST AID consists in applying a pressure bandage. A bandage (gauze) is applied to the bleeding area, you can use a clean handkerchief or bleached cloth.",

      "type": "Fainting",
      "info": "FAINTING is a sudden short–term loss of consciousness, accompanied by a weakening of the activity of the heart and breathing. It occurs with rapidly developing anemia of the brain and lasts from a few seconds to 5-10 minutes or more.\n\nSIGNS. Fainting is expressed in sudden nausea, dizziness, weakness and loss of consciousness. Fainting is accompanied by paleness and coldness of the skin. Breathing is slow, shallow, weak and rare pulse (up to 40-50 beats per minute).",
      "first_aid": "First of all, it is necessary to lay the victim on his back so that the head is slightly lowered and the legs are raised. To facilitate breathing, release the neck and chest from the constricting clothes. Cover the victim warmly, put a heating pad at his feet. Rub ammonia on the patient's temples and bring a cotton wool soaked in ammonia to the nose, and sprinkle cold water on the face. In case of prolonged fainting, artificial respiration is indicated. After regaining consciousness, give him hot coffee.",

      "type": "Fracture",
      "info": "A fracture is a violation of the integrity of a bone caused by violence or a pathological process. Open fractures are characterized by the presence of a wound in the fracture area, and closed fractures are characterized by the absence of a violation of the integrity of the integument (skin or mucous membrane). It should be remembered that a fracture can be accompanied by complications: damage to the sharp ends of bone fragments of large blood vessels, which leads to external bleeding (if there is an open wound) or intracranial hemorrhage (with a closed fracture); damage to nerve trunks, causing shock or paralysis; infection of the wound and the development of phlegmon, the occurrence of osteomyelitis or a general purulent infection; damage to internal organs (brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, etc.).\n\nSIGNS: severe pain, deformity and impaired motor function of the limb, shortening of the limb, peculiar bone crunch.",
      "first_aid": "FIRST AID consists in ensuring the immobility of bone fragments (transport immobilization) of the damaged limb with tires or sticks, planks, etc. available at hand. If there are no objects for immobilization at hand, then the damaged arm should be bandaged to the trunk, the damaged leg to the healthy one. In case of a spinal fracture, the victim is transported on a shield. In case of an open fracture, accompanied by profuse bleeding, a pressure aseptic bandage is applied and, according to indications, a hemostatic tourniquet. It should be borne in mind that the application of a tourniquet is limited to the minimum possible period. The affected person is given painkillers: baralgin, sedalgin, analgin, amidopyrine, diphenhydramine, dosage depending on the age of the victim.",

      "info": "A wound is a mechanical damage to the integument of the body, often accompanied by a violation of the integrity of muscles, nerves, large vessels, bones, internal organs, cavities and joints. Depending on the nature of the damage and the type of injuring object, there are wounds cut, stabbed, chopped, bruised, crushed, gunshot, torn and bitten. Wounds can be superficial, deep and penetrating into the body cavity.\n\nThe causes of injury may be various physical or mechanical effects. Depending on their strength, nature, characteristics and places of application, they can lead to various skin and mucous defects, injuries to blood vessels, damage to internal organs, bones, nerve trunks and cause acute pain.",
      "first_aid": "A bandage should be applied to any wound, aseptic (sterile) if possible. The means of applying an aseptic dressing in most cases is a medical dressing bag, and in its absence – a sterile bandage, cotton wool, lignin and, in extreme cases, a clean cloth. If the injury is accompanied by significant bleeding, it is necessary to stop it in any appropriate way. In case of extensive soft tissue injuries, bone fractures and wounds of large blood vessels and nerve trunks, immobilization of the limb with standard or improvised means is necessary. The victim must be injected with an anesthetic and given antibiotics. The victim must be taken to a medical facility as soon as possible.",

      "info": "CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING occurs when inhaled and refers to acute poisoning. The formation of carbon monoxide occurs during combustion and in production conditions. Gorenje It is found in blast furnace, furnace, mine, tunnel, and light gases. In the chemical industry, it is formed during technical processes in which this chemical compound serves as a starting material for the synthesis of acetone, phosgene, methyl alcohol, methane, etc.\n\nSIGNS: headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dazed state, severe muscle weakness, blackout, loss of consciousness, coma. When exposed to high concentrations of carbon monoxide, severe poisoning is observed, which is characterized by loss of consciousness, prolonged coma, leading to death in particularly severe cases. At the same time, there is an expansion of the pupils with a sluggish reaction to light, an attack of convulsions, sharp tension (rigidity) of the muscles, rapid shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat. Death occurs when breathing and cardiac activity stop.",

The main signs of bruises located on the surface of the tissues are pain and swelling at the site of injury. Swelling associated with swelling of bruised tissues, and in severe bruises also with hemorrhage, is detected more often after 2-3 days. With hemorrhage, a bruise usually appears at the site of the injury in the form of a blue-purple spot.",
      "first_aid": "1.To ease the pain and reduce hemorrhage, cold should be applied immediately: make a cold lotion, put an ice pack.\n\n\n2.It is also recommended to apply a pressure bandage and ensure the rest of the bruised part of the body: hang your arm on a scarf, lay your leg high on a pillow.  Very severe pain after a bruise can mean bone damage. You can not rub the bruised area yourself, this can lead to thrombophlebitis. If the swelling and hematoma do not disappear, you should consult a doctor.  With severe bruises of the head (especially if they are accompanied by nausea, loss of consciousness), chest, abdomen, the brain and internal organs may be damaged. In such cases, it is necessary \n\n\n3.to provide the victim with rest and seek medical help.",

Under the influence of heat (Joule heat), which is formed when an electric current passes through the tissues of the body, burns occur. Electric current usually causes deep burns. All pathological disorders caused by electrical trauma can be explained by the direct effect of electric current when passing through the tissues of the body; side effects caused by the passage of current in the environment outside the body.\n\n SIGNS. As a result of the direct effect of current on the body, common phenomena occur (disorders of the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory systems, etc.).\n\nSide effects in the environment (heat, light, sound) can cause changes in the body (blinding and burns with a voltaic arc, damage to the hearing organs, etc.).",
